<h2>About Me</h2>
<b>I‚Äôm a self-taught Python programmer who has an interest in developing pipelines, automation, and data engineering. My projects showcase real-world applications of data processing, using tools like Apache Airflow, APIs, SQL, and workflow automation. Below, you‚Äôll find highlights of my work, including my learnings and technical takeaways.</b>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

- <b>(Key Project) Minneapolis and Madison Exercise Competition</b>
  - This project utilizes google sheets to track workouts from my friends and I. It pulls this data and processes it to provide both individual and group insights that were then emailed out to users each week.
  - Key Skills: Python, Apache Airflow, DAGs, API‚Äôs, Data Aggregation, Data Manipulation, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Iterative Development, OOP Design and Modularity, Personalized Reporting, Email Automation

- <b>(Upcoming Project) Prescription Glasses Inventory Management System</b>
  - In February 2025, I went on a medical mission trip to a northern rural area in the Philippines. The group complained about the shortcomings of their current software and listed a host of things that they wished were different. None of which seemed out of reach for me to develop, and so this is my current project. I made no promises, but if I‚Äôm successful, it will help more people receive prescription glasses that they wouldn‚Äôt have access to otherwise.

- <b>Music Taste Spotlight</b>
  - Music is important to my friends, and I wanted to provide an avenue for my friends to spotlight things they‚Äôve been listening to without taking up the entire night in the short weekends we get to get together. This project allows anyone to ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù for a little while and play songs in 60 second increments either from the queue or a created playlist. I also built in functionality for people to choose the start times of their songs and end point if 60 seconds isn‚Äôt ideal. This utilized Spotify‚Äôs api with some logic to feed in the proper parameters or default when needed.
  - Key Skills: API Integration, Authentication, Authorization, Data Manipulation, Time Management, Error Handling, OOP Design and Modularity

- <b>Preference Analyzer</b>
  - A Python based tool that uses google sheets to track preferences from multiple participants for different food or drinks. This was initially developed for a whiskey tasting where each of my friends rated each bottle from 0 to 100. The application then pulled these ratings and processed them to provide key insights like which bottle was the collective favorite, which was most cost efficient, which was most or least polarizing, and a personalized ranked list for who each user agreed with most in terms of general rankings.
  - Key Skills: Data Extraction, Transformation with Pandas, Data Validation, Data Aggregation, Automation, Email Automation, Python, Modularity, Personalized Reporting
